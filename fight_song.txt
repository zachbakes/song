HSE School Fight Song

Hamilton Southeastern High,
We are the Royals brave and true

We never fall, we never fail.
You know that we are for the Red, White, and Blue.

On the beam, big Royal Team,
You know our spirits will not die.

So come on now, let's have a victory,
For the Royals - FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT!

R-R-R-OY, A-A-A-LS, R-O-Y-A-L-S
ROYALS, ROYALS, ROYALS!!!

LOST VERSE:
We allways fail, and manage to lose
They spend too much money on the football team
